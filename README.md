**Note:** The popular VESC won't work with the current program as it does not have BEC so it is a little bit different wiring wise and would require a small modification to the program and layout of the wiring. 

**Hardware Parts:**

I did not add the skateboard parts to this table as everyone has different preferences for what type of board and wheels they want to use. You just have to make sure that the wheels you buy fit the 3D printed wheel gear and also make sure the trucks you buy are wide enough to allow space for the mechanical drive to operate even with the added width of the motor bracket (see figure 1). It is for this reason most people use longboard trucks for their electric skateboards since these are wider.

**Note:** The motor mount used is a custom made mount out of steel. You can also buy an already fabricated one but you have to make sure it fits the motor you choose to use. 

## Wiring

![Setup](doc/images/setup.jpg)
NOT TO SCALE
## PiSkate install
**1.**  Install a fresh jesse image on the micro SD of the Pi3
**2.**  Install cwiid:

    sudo apt-get install python-cwiid
Now the program should run when you manually start it from the command line.
**3.**  Edit the rc.local file if you want to have the program auto-start at boot:

    sudo nano /etc/rc.local

Then add the path to the piskate.py program at the end of the rc.local file:
    
    python /home/pi/piskate.py

This will auto start the piskate.py program every time the Pi boots.
